	<h1><i>My Experience In my Life?</h1></i>
	<p>In the fall of 2012, I was a student at MRSM Jeli, Kelantan. I started my journey as a MRSM student on February 8, 2012 for 5 years. Following that, I continued my studies in a Diploma of Business Studies at KPM Ayer Molek, Melaka, and am now a full-time student in a degree of finance at UITM Kota Bharu, Kelantan.</p>
